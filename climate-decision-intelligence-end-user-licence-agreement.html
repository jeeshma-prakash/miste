            3.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
            The End User understands and agrees that:

            (a) the Services proposed to be supplied to the End User by mistEO under this EULA may be contingent upon
            certain assumptions being true and certain dependencies being fulfilled by the End User;

            (b) mistEO reserves its right to cancel or terminate (in whole or in part) this EULA if any of the

            As consideration for, among other things, the Services, the End User will pay Fees in accordance with and as

            5 Invoicing and payment
            5.1 Invoice
            mistEO will invoice the End User in respect of the Fees as set out in Schedule 1 via a third-party payment
            gateway.

            5.2 Incorrectly rendered invoice
            The End User must make a payment under this EULA unless it receives an incorrectly rendered invoice. An
            invoice is incorrectly rendered if the End User can demonstrate with evidence that the payment amount
            specified is incorrect.

            5.3 Payment terms
            Subject to clause 5.2, the End User must pay mistEO any invoice issued by mistEO under this EULA within the
            timeframe specified in the Payment Terms set out in Schedule 1.

            5.4 GST exclusive
            (a) Any consideration or amount payable under this EULA, including any non-monetary consideration (as
            reduced in accordance with clause 5.4(e) if required) (Consideration) is exclusive of GST.

            (b) If GST is or becomes payable on a Supply made under or in connection with this EULA, an additional
            amount (Additional Amount) is payable by the party providing consideration for the Supply (Recipient) equal
            to the amount of GST payable on that Supply as calculated by the party making the Supply (Supplier) in
            accordance with the GST Law.

            (c) The Additional Amount payable under clause 5.4(b) is payable at the same time and in the same manner as
            the Consideration for the Supply, and the Supplier must provide the Recipient with a Tax Invoice immediately
            after the time of payment of the Additional Amount. The Additional Amount is only payable on receipt of a
            valid Tax Invoice.

            (d) If for any reason (including, without limitation, the occurrence of an Adjustment Event) the amount of
            GST payable on a Supply (taking into account any decreasing or increasing Adjustments in relation to the
            Supply) varies from the Additional Amount payable by the Recipient under clause 5.4(b):

            (i) the Supplier must provide a refund or credit to the Recipient, or the Recipient must pay a further
            amount to the Supplier, as appropriate;

            (ii) the refund, credit or further amount (as the case may be) will be calculated by the Supplier in
            accordance with the GST Law; and

            (iii) the Supplier must notify the Recipient of the refund, credit or further amount within 14 days after
            becoming aware of the variation to the amount of GST payable. Any refund or credit must accompany such
            notification, or the Recipient must pay any further amount within 7 days after receiving such notification,
            as appropriate. If there is an Adjustment Event in relation to the Supply, the requirement for the Supplier
            to notify the Recipient will be satisfied by the Supplier issuing to the Recipient an Adjustment Note within
            14 days after becoming aware of the occurrence of the Adjustment Event.

            (e) Despite any other provision in this EULA:

            (i) if an amount payable under or in connection with this EULA (whether by way of reimbursement, indemnity
            or otherwise) is calculated by reference to an amount incurred by a party, whether by way of cost, expense,
            outlay, disbursement or otherwise (Amount Incurred), the amount payable must be reduced by the amount of any
            Input Tax Credit to which that party is entitled in respect of that Amount Incurred; and

            (ii) no Additional Amount is payable under clause 5.4(b) in respect of a Supply to which s 84-5 of the GST
            Law applies.

            (f) Any reference in this clause to an Input Tax Credit to which a party is entitled includes an Input Tax
            Credit arising from a Creditable Acquisition by that party but to which the Representative Member of a GST
            Group of which the party is a member is entitled.

            6 Platform
            6.1 Use of Platform

            Accepted Use.

            6.2 Disclaimers
            (a) mistEO does not and cannot control the flow of data to or from the Platform and other portions of the
