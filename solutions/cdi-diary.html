                            production towards maintaining body temperature. Studies show a potential decrease
                            in milk yield of up to 20%, directly impacting farm profitability.</p>

                        <p>Elevated temperatures can lead to a range of health problems in dairy cattle.
                            Increased panting and sweating can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
                            Reduced feed intake weakens the immune system, making cows more susceptible to
                            diseases like mastitis. Heat stress can also negatively impact reproductive
                            performance.</p>

                        <h4>Operational Challenges: </h4>
                        <p>Managing heat stress often requires additional resources and operational changes.
                            Implementing cooling strategies like sprinklers or fans can increase energy
                            consumption. Heat-stressed cows may spend less time grazing, impacting feed
                            utilization and potentially increasing labor costs associated with managing feed
                            intake.

                <p>
                    It has become evident in recent years that weather patterns are changing. A range of factors,
                    including
                    climate change, are contributing to weather events that are more unpredictable and require greater
                    monitoring and preparation to manage risk. Other heat load management tools available have
                    forecasting
                    models based on data that is over 20 years old. The team behind the Climate Decision Intelligence
                    platform
                    have brought the model up to date with the latest weather data and forecasting technology, so you
                    can have
                    the most accurate data guiding your heat load management practices. It’s all about giving feedlot
                    operators
                    the best information so they can make the right decisions for their herd. You’ll have all the
                    features
                    you’re used to in a heat management tool, just with better data!<br>

                    There are also other benefits to switching, including a mobile friendly interface for checking the
                    platform
                    on the go, access to a growing library of heat load management resources and a range of exciting new

                <p>
                    The CDI platform integrates a wide range of data sources including satellite imagery, stationary
                    sensors,
                    radar and third party data into our proprietary platform to deliver climate intelligence services
                    for
                    feedlots.<br>

                    Our proprietary models have been developed with academic and industry experts in animal husbandry
                    and other
                    niche fields to unlock deeper insights for climate resilient farming. With the use of artificial
                    intelligence and machine learning, our platform is constantly improving and evolving to help feedlot
                    operators minimise the impact of weather events on their cattle.</p>

                <p>
                    The CDI platform has a very user-friendly interface and the feedback from our early users is that
                    the system
                    is very easy to operate. For extra peace of mind, every new user is taken through an initial
                    training
                    session on the platform. We will also be hosting regular webinars for new users to attend and become
                    familiar with the program.

                    When using CDI, there is a dedicated support team based in Australia, so you can raise a ticket
                    inside the
                    platform, or give us a call for assistance.</p>
